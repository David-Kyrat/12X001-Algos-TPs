# DEFINITIONS:
QUEEN = "ðŸ‘¸"
WHITE = "â¬œ"
BLACK = "â¬›"



#!
#!
#! As was allowed, The N-Queen problem was implemented like in the lecture notes.
#! Please execute the main function in queen.py with different values of n 
#! to see/test the implementation.
#! Nontheless A copy of the output was added at the end of file, you can verify that it is 
#! the same as the one generate when queen.py is run and also the same one as in your tests 
# For n=5, you can check the correctness of the solutions with the ones at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-ten-solutions-of-the-5-queens-problem_fig1_226219656
# For n=6 : https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Four-solutions-to-the-6-queens-problem_fig2_250697280#:~:text=Context%201-,...,as%20shown%20in%20Figure%201.
